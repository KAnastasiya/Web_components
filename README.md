# Web_components

My first steps in learning Web-components

**Attention!** Now web-components work only in Chrome and Opera (look at [can i use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elements)).


### Installation

1. Download source code.
2. Run `npm install` in catalog with source code (to get the project's dependencies).


### Getting started

1. Run local-server with client-side part of service.
*Run `npm run dev` in catalog with source code (to produce development version and run a watcher at localhost:8080)*.
2. Open url `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.


### Build
